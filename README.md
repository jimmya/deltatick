# Delta Tick

Detla Tick is a simple app to view your portfolio status in your Mac OS Status bar.

To install simply drag the app to your `Applications` folder.
When started, Delta Tick prompts you to scan the QR code. Scan this QR code from de Detla app on your phone. After scanning your portfolio is synced and ready to use.

To sync with another device simply select the `Sync` option from the menu to be presented with another QR code. If an error occurs you can select the `Reset` option from the menu to completely reset the app and start over (your portfolio will not be changed).
